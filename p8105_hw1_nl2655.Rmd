# Problem 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


p1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = rnorm>0,
  vec_char = c("LENGTH_1","LENGTH_2","LENGTH_3","LENGTH_4","LENGTH_5","LENGTH_6","LENGTH_7","LENGTH_8"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("l","m","s","s","m","l","m","s"))
)

```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
